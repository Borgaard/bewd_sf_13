#1 - Create 5 or more hashes with cars - include 5 keys
  #- brand, model, year, price, is_electric
#2 - Create an array of hashes
#3 - Iterate through the array using the `.each` method
#4 - Practice using `if` && `unless` conditionals (print a special message when cars are good for the enviornment)
#5 -BONUS create an `:add_cars` method that takes an unlimited number of cars and transforms them into an array

require 'pry'

def show_all_cars(cars)
end

#write a method that accepts an unlimited number of cars (or arguments)
def add_cars()
end
