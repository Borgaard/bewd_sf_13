#Back End Web Development - Cohort 13

At the beginning of class, pull the latest changes from this repo down to your `bewd_sf_13` directory in terminal.

The remotes  (`git remote -v` to check) to this repository should look like this:

    origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bewd_sf_13 (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bewd_sf_13 (push)
    upstream	https://github.com/ga-students/bewd_sf_13(fetch)
    upstream	https://github.com/ga-students/bewd_sf_13 (push)

The origin and upstream remote names are nicknames for your Github repository urls so you can easily push and pull.    **Note:** see a TA if your remotes end with .git and you're having trouble pulling lessons.


From your master branch (`git branch`) in `bewd_sf_13` directory, pull from upstream with `git pull upstream master`. You can `ls` to list the new files you've pulled in.
