BEWD: FINAL PROJECT
--------

#DESCRIPTION
For the final project you will use your knowledge of back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. You will choose the type of web application you’d like to create. Don’t worry; you have some time to think about what you would like to do.

The objectives:

- Demonstrate understanding of all topics covered during this course.

- Apply knowledge gained during this course by building a web application from the ground up.

The final project encapsulates everything you’ve learned in this course. We want to make sure you are successful in your venture, so to stay on track we suggest you take our milestone suggestions seriously. In addition, we will help define scope and guide you through the process.


##CORE REQUIREMENTS
Projects must include:

- An about page or a detailed description of your app.

- User accounts. Your application must utilize user login (authentication and authorization capability)

-   Hosted. No need to pay for hosting services, you can  Heroku, set up an account as soon a possible. 

-   Ruby Gems. Use a Ruby Gem (not the Rails defaults, obviously they don't count). Some ideas to look into: twilio-gem, carrier wave, 

-   Validations to handle invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. (i.e. validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords).

- NOTE: Scaffolding is completely prohibited in final projects

- Make use of associations. At least two of your models should be associated.

- Basic Front Integration using Bootstrap 

- Extra Credit: API integration (i.e., etsy for an example) 


##DELIVERABLES
Your project will be deployed to Heroku and your source code will be submitted via GitHub. You will share the link for both with your instructor.

##BEST PRACTICES
The instructional team will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind. 

* Clean And Readable Code. The instructional team should be able to read and follow code easily.  Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing ```<div>``` tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices) and use proper and consistent naming conventions.

* RESTful. Implement some non-default (defaults are: add, create, update, destroy) RESTful routes to demonstrate your understanding of RESTful routing in Rails.


##GRADING
A project is considered satisfactory if it meets all core requirements. Anything extra is encouraged.
